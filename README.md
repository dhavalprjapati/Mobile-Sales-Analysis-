🚀 Power BI Dashboard: Mobile Sales Analysis 📊
I'm excited to share a dashboard I created to analyze mobile sales data using Power BI
This report covers:
✅ Total Sales, Quantity, and Transactions
✅ City-wise and Model-wise Sales Distribution
✅ Monthly & Daily Sales Trends
✅ Customer Ratings & Age Filters
✅ Payment Method Breakdown

It was a great hands-on experience in applying DAX, Power Query, and data visualization best practices to deliver insights that are both actionable and visually impactful.
